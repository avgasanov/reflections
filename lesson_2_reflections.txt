You initialize git directory to track changes to your files. That way you could commit changes and get old versions of your files whether you want to do it.
I think it make possible to commit changes to a few files. 
You can check your changes before commit
Branch helps in organizing history. That way you could develop programm in different ways and versions in parallel
By visualising branch you have more information about different versions of your code and can decide whether you want merge versions for example
We merge our code in one result code. Thus, our two different versions become one that reflects all changes that we've made. Representing in diagram is just the way we visualize our different versions of the code.
Automatic merging saves our time and help us to get correct merged version. Although, sometimes conflicts occurs and we have to fix them by ourselves.
